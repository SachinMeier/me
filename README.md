<h2>A Personal Website</h2>

This is a personal website I cloned from https://github.com/jules23/perso. I've since added several features. 


<h3>Personal Use</h3>
If you'd like to make your own personal site with just the main page, I'd 
suggest cloning jules23/perso. Alternatively, clone this repository and remove all the
<code>app.get(...)</code> functions from index.js for all undesired pages. You should also personalize or remove the metadata I have included in <code>header.ejs</code>. Good luck!
